<p>Eastward Review: Retro Perfection</p>

<p>Growing up, I rarely came across games that put my Chinese culture in the limelight by an Asian development team. Most Asian games I encountered were Japanese-themed games oversaturated with samurais and katanas and made by Western developers, or games by Eastern developers who were clearly influenced by the West, depicting medieval knights and castles. This all changed in 2018, when a little game called Eastward was announced, showcasing a scintillating trailer filled with blooming colors, a bombastic cast of characters, and, to my surprise, many traces of my heritage. Developed by Pixpil, a small team of three based in Shanghai, and published by Chucklefish, Eastward has finally opened its doors to a world waiting to be explored.</p>

<p>Pixpil’s debut title is an indie action adventure role playing game that pays homage to Zelda and Earthbound, the retro classics we played under the sheets as children after the lights went out. It not only cleverly utilizes 90s-era Ghibli-style animation and beautifully hand-crafted pixel art to create a world full of life, but also weaves in a gorgeously composed 8-bit soundtrack to bring even more color to an already vibrant universe. Perhaps a subtle tribute to the renowned Chinese novel Journey to the West, where a Buddhist monk sets out on a pilgrimage to the West, Eastward stars silent protagonist John and his adoptive daughter Sam in a post-apocalyptic world as they embark on an adventure to the East.</p>

<p>The journey begins at Potcrock Isle, a subterranean society where John and Sam live, sheltered from the outside world. The origins of Sam are unknown, as she was found in an experiment tank deep underground by John. Ruled by a mayor with an iron fist, Potcrock Isle indoctrinates its citizens, especially the children, to never travel to the surface, warning that it is filled with nothing but danger, death, and haunted by an entity known as the Miasma. Sam, being the energetic troublemaker that she is, claims that she has been to the outside world before, where the skies are baby blue and the lands are lush green. One day, an apparition doppelganger of Sam allures her to go against the Mayor’s orders and break the surface, causing herself and John to be exiled. Along the way, they meet Jasper the one man show, William the merchant and his robot companion Daniel, Solomon the mysterious entity, rocket scientist Princess Alva and her guardian knight Isabel, and a whole array of other personalities.</p>

<p>The relationship that John and Sam have isn’t your typical father-daughter dynamic. Don’t let John’s grizzly, rough exterior and lack of words fool you. Pixpil brilliantly utilizes John’s inability to speak to instead accentuate his actions as his way of expressing his emotions and affection towards Sam. Sam, on the other hand, shows her love for John through the antics of a typical child, asking John to carry her because she’s too tired to walk or cook because she’s hungry. The lovely bond that the two have keeps the narrative engaging all the way through the end, and you can see it in small moments, like when Sam runs over to John for a hug.</p>

<p>The surface is indeed nothing like Potcrock Isle described, and is instead the most colorful and vibrant dystopia you have ever seen. What is true, however, is that the decaying world is indeed threatened by a mysterious blight known as the Miasma. From the luscious fields of Greenberg and the bustling streets of New Dam City to the snowy tips of Ester City, the Miasma destroys everything in its path. The narrative of the game is unclear initially, as the game uses the opening hours for mood setting, world building, and character development. The game, which starts off as light-hearted and innocent, suddenly takes a dark and serious turn as Sam’s past catches up with her present and themes of morality and integrity are challenged. Where did the Miasma come from? Who is the apparition version of Sam? Why does everyone refer to Sam as “mother”? The narrative is a slow burn buildup that requires a lot of patience, but is well worth it in the end.</p>

<p>Perhaps what draws people into Eastward is the surreal universe created by the gorgeous pixel art and retro 8-bit soundtrack. Visually and aurally speaking, Eastward is at the forefront of its genre. The pixel art not only combines different palettes of exuberant colors to exude a distinct personality in each area you visit; it also doesn’t take away from the narrative’s more somber moments. Oftentimes, I found myself getting lost in the city, admiring the intricate details of my surroundings as John and Sam went about their tasks, all the while bopping my head to the OST. Though there is no voice acting and all dialogue happens in text bubbles, the brilliantly composed 8-bit electronic soundtrack by Joel Corelitz, who also worked on Death Stranding and Halo Infinite, lovingly complements the artwork and brings Eastward to life.</p>

<p>Eastward takes inspiration from many old school rpgs in the most lighthearted and brilliant sense. Where most games have you wielding a sword, axe, shield, or gun as your weapon of choice, Eastward has you swinging a frying pan that only grows bigger as you upgrade it. Pixpil also introduces the refreshing element of dual gameplay, in which you can switch between John and Sam at any time. John is responsible for the brute jobs, whacking monsters and destroying pillars, whereas Sam comes into play with her psychic abilities to trigger switches and stun enemies. Each new weapon or ability introduced serves a meaningful role in the gameplay. Unlocked a flamethrower for John? You need it to reach previously unreachable areas. Unlocked an energy blast for Sam? You need it to solve certain puzzles.</p>

<p>Gameplay is akin to an old school Legend of Zelda game, where you meander through towns, talk to citizens, explore dungeons, and find hidden treasure chests. Puzzles and dungeons make inventive use of the dual gameplay mechanic, frequently requiring you to switch between John and Sam to solve a puzzle or proceed through a dungeon. Pixpil manages to strike that perfect balance between puzzles being just hard enough to get your brain juices flowing, but not too difficult to cause frustration. The solution often depends on your timing and execution skills, rather than raw logic. Exploring dungeons and talking to friendly NPCs in a town are also highly encouraged, as hidden chests contain Zelda-like heart containers to increase your permanent health and townsfolk might give you some fresh fruit or veggies for free if you talk to them. Upgrade materials for your weapons are also found scattered throughout the maze like dungeons. There’s also a relaxing slice of life element added in Eastward with the cooking mechanic, allowing you to combine different ingredients to prepare some delicious meals. As an Asian, I thoroughly enjoyed being able to make bubble milk tea, naengmyeon noodles, and naan bread to heal and buff up John and Sam.</p>

<p>Combat, for the most part, is simple yet satisfying and never dull. Though your melee weapon is a frying pan, you also gain access to ranged weapons and bombs. Sam’s magical abilities also become more diverse, but her kit is not nearly as impactful as John’s. While you do call upon Sam in many situations, she mostly takes a backseat when it comes to combat, allowing her fatherly figure to fulfill his loyal duties. Just as each new area you visit is unique, so are enemy types and bosses. The combat is more than just swinging your frying pan and shooting your gun. Many times, combat requires you to move strategically around the arena, dodging incoming hits, and switching to Sam to penetrate shields or activate switches. Boss encounters are not only exciting and challenging, but refreshing as well due to outstanding level design. Each fight knits in the presence of the environment so that you have to make use of the stage to your advantage to succeed. This made each encounter feel like an exhilarating puzzle-combat hybrid.</p>

<p>Not only is Eastward sprinkled with little secrets, minigames, and areas to explore, it also contains an entire game within the game! Loosely woven into the narrative as a video game enjoyed among the youngins in Eastward, Earth Born is a full-fledged Dragon Quest-like rpg that you can play at computer terminals found in each city. It even contains its own gacha system that you can play to collect different figurines and serves as a welcome break when you want to take a step back from the main narrative.</p>

<p>Many of the areas you visit encompass the walks of life of many cultures, both fictitious and existent. Frame by frame, there are neon lit signs of pachinko casinos, traditional Buddhist temples, subway stations labeled in Mandarin, and you even have the recipes for pho and dumplings! The effort put in by the development conveys appreciation of a multitude of cultures. What a fitting name Eastward is for this game; there is an immense lack of Eastern Asian representation in the video game industry, and Pixpil took the momentous first step.</p>

<p>Eastward proudly wears its inspirations on its sleeves,combining each of their strengths to create a game that is nothing short of a masterpiece. It’s clear that the developers of Pixpil poured their heart and soul into this project that delivers not only intuitive gameplay and an emotional experience, but a relic of their passion as well. With a charming ensemble of characters, especially the infectiously cute Sam, brought to life by the exquisitely-drawn pixel art, forever on-repeat soundtrack, and an impactful story filled with mythos, Eastward is not just a game, but an emotion that feels a lot like home, and I miss it already.</p>
