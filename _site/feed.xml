&lt;p&gt;Last Stop Review: Superb Narrative Hindered by Non-Gameplay&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would you do if you were given the choice of improving your own life at the cost of another’s? The moral dilemma and the gap between selfish and selfless are brought to light by the newest game from developer Variable State. Last Stop is a supernatural sci-fi drama adventure game focused mainly on the narrative that feels like a crossover episode between Doctor Who and The Twilight Zone. However, the game feels like a story that could’ve been told without the video game mechanics. Last Stop is a game about unremarkable people embarking on extraordinary events. The five-hour adventure is split into three separate tales that revolve around three characters that have nothing in common until they ultimately intermingle to form a wider plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prologue of Last Stop begins in a London subway station in 1982. Two teenagers are being chased by police through maintenance corridors when they encounter a mysterious man in a brown suit. The man opens a door behind him, revealing an otherworldly portal, and beckons the two to step in. While Samantha walks through the portal, Peter, the boy, chickens out and is arrested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward twenty years, the three stories play out over the course of seven chapters. You are free to choose who’s story arc to play first, per chapter. First, there’s John Smith, a disorganized single dad struggling to make ends meet. His story begins when a curse leads him and his neighbor Jack to swap bodies, Freaky Friday style. Then, we have Meena Hughes, an unfaithful, career-obsessed woman who has ruined her relationship with her father, husband, and son. She removes herself further when she is pressured to compete for a promotion she has been working so hard towards. Lastly, we have Donna Adeleke, an ordinary London high-schooler struggling with her home life and friendships. She becomes an accidental kidnapper after trailing a suspicious neighbor that doesn’t seem entirely human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The developer does a brilliant job with its art style, story-telling, and sound design. The design is minimalistic, focusing on the characters rather than the backdrop. Last Stop manages to capture the chemistry and personality of the cast through their interactions and expressions. There are a few mishaps due to awkward animations and words not matching the movements of each character’s mouth, but there’s a good mix of strong writing and voice acting to keep players engaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gameplay, on the other hand, is extremely limited by scope. These elements include choosing dialogue options, walking, quick-time events, and the occasional puzzle or mini-game. The mini-games are refreshing and include events such as putting books back on a shelf and piecing together broken ceramic ware. But, unfortunately, in most cases, the interactions you have as a player are largely meaningless and inconsequential, to the point where it feels like a chore to make a character jog faster or scoop cereal and drink coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While my interest remained in the story, the game requires you to walk long distances without any real reason. From your house to school, to the store, to the office. Sometimes, it’s not obvious which way you should be walking, so you end up walking into an invisible wall before realizing you were going in the wrong direction. Further, any dialogue choices, whether to make a particular character cold and harsh or warm and endearing, make absolutely no difference in the outcome of the narrative. This causes the experience to really fall out of touch with its gameplay elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The journey to get to the meat of the narrative ends up being a predictable ride. When the paths finally connect, Last Stop does a great job tying up loose ends while leaving others intentionally untied for the player’s interpretation. There’s a fantastic authenticity in the characters as I found each of them relatable. The moral and existential decisions they are faced with are still lingering in my mind. Although a sci-fi narrative, the focus is always on the ordinary lives instead of the supernatural element. Variable State also did a great job intermingling characters of different personalities: Meena being a logical, ruthless, alpha, Donna being an innocent teenager, and John being a comic relief and an overall goofball. Although the final chapter is enjoyable due to its twists and turns, the ending is paced awkwardly, weighing on the entire experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Stop serves up a strong narrative, mixing existentialism with the lives of ordinary people, but it forgets to be a game at some points. The interaction and story bits keep you invested at the cost of choices and navigation segments that do nothing for the adventure. At its best, Last Stop should be enjoyed as a casual narrative-focused experience, but asking anything more of it may have you exiting before the end of the line.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">death trash (early access review)</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/reviews/self/2021/08/05/deathtrash.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="death trash (early access review)" /><published>2021-08-05T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-08-05T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/reviews/self/2021/08/05/deathtrash</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/reviews/self/2021/08/05/deathtrash.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/deathtrash.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mos&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Death Trash Preview: A Grotesque Wasteland of Cosmic Flesh&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to modern day gaming aesthetics, a large focus has been on utilizing photorealism to make worlds look as clean-cut and pristine as possible. However, developers Crafting Legends decided to go the opposite route. Their upcoming game, Death Trash, is set in a mucky, filthy, gory, and trash-ridden world filled with mystery and Lovecraftian secrets, and I’m loving it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Death Trash is an open-world, post-cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic isometric pixelated rpg with an emphasis on delivering a strong narrative. The story takes place on Planet Nexus, centuries after The Bleeding. Humanity has been driven into hiding as bloodthirsty machinery and otherworldly creatures scour the planet to terminate any remaining survivors. You are cast out of a safe underground community, for reasons unknown other than there is an eldritch sickness growing inside of your body. You are told to never return or you will face immediate termination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before being thrown into the dystopian wasteland, you learn the basics of movement, interaction, combat, and stealth in a training facility that acts as the tutorial to the game’s mechanics. In Death Trash, you are free to do whatever you want and go wherever you want, although you will face the consequences of the choices you make. For example, I’m really interested in seeing how attacking friendly main quest givers may affect your progression in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Character creation takes from classic role playing games, where you can choose any combination of body types, outfits, among other customizations. You have a variety of core stats that dictate your playstyle. Hardiness increases your health and resistances. Strength allows the use of better melee weapons while finesse allows the use of better ranged weapons. Occultism allows you to use abilities that communicate with the flesh. Cybertech allows you to use implants and tech abilities. Empathy unlocks dialogue options that influence interactions with characters found in the world. In addition, you also have skills that range from animalism to pickpocketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although combat is quite simplistic, with your typical melee attack and dodge, there’s the added versatility of firearms and cyber augmentations as well. However, the dodge roll system is a little wonky and you can quickly become overwhelmed and killed by how many and how hard enemies hit, even on the easiest difficulty. Fortunately, there is freedom in how you approach combat, as you can take a more tactical approach by sneaking past enemies via stealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meat, flesh, and puke play a significant role in Death Trash. Not long after you venture out into the wasteland, you meet a giant “Flesh-Kraken” that requests you to find a friend for it. Scattered throughout the world are lumps of flesh that you can either attack or tame, depending on how you allocate your skills. Meat’s importance is further revealed through the townsfolk’s obsession with it, as well as its role as a “potion” that restores your health when eaten. Heck, there’s even a location called Puke Bar, where you can get drunk and puke alongside other fellow outcasts. Some ancient machinery also operates when fueled with your “bio-lubricant”, or puke. Did I mention you can also puke on demand?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game clearly draws inspiration from games such as Fallout and folklore from HP Lovecraft, but it manages to forge its own identity, weaving together a mysterious narrative, challenging gameplay and a whole lot of flesh. In the current landscape of gaming, where most games feel derivative, Death Trash feels unique given its distinctive art direction, deep mythos, and rich rpg elements. Death Trash has a lot of meat on the bone for anyone craving a fleshy and juicy treat. After all, one person’s Trash may be another’s treasure. Having been in development for six years, the game is finally making its celestial debut in Early Access on Steam on August 5, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was very impressed and intrigued by the Early Access version of Death Trash, which is roughly one third of the final story campaign. I can’t wait to see what the developers have in store for the full release in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">the ascent (full review)</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/reviews/self/2021/07/29/ascent.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="the ascent (full review)" /><published>2021-07-29T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-07-29T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/reviews/self/2021/07/29/ascent</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/reviews/self/2021/07/29/ascent.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ascent.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mos&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewed from a distance, Veles, the cyberpunk planet dominated by The Ascent Group’s arcology, looks like a massive and sprawling metropolis filled with life and promise. A closer look reveals the chaos and confusion that ensue in the wake of the collapse of the Ascent Group, the mega corporation that owns everyone. You play as an indent, or an indentured worker, who must ascend to the top of the social hierarchy and figure out what really happened. The Ascent is a solo and cooperative open world, isometric, top-down, twin-stick action rpg.  Like other games of the same genre, The Ascent may seem like the long-awaited fulfillment of the promise of a great cyberpunk experience. However, when experienced from up close, players will find that The Ascent is far from that, and will soon be forgotten in the shadows of its failed predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Veles is a vivid and intricate city, filled with neon signs, flashy billboards, futuristic hover cars, monolithic skyscrapers, and creatures from all over the galaxy. Neon Giant does a fantastic job creating a game drenched in atmosphere, weaving together conversations of passersby going about their day, billboard announcements over the speaker, endless drops of pouring rain, and neo noir electro synth soundtrack in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Veles may have you in awe with its remarkable visual and auditory aesthetic at first, you will soon feel like you are wandering tediously in a lifeless static world. To put open world and isometric rpg together is a bold undertaking. Though the world is filled with NPCs, Veles is nothing but a giant landscape of reused assets and enemy types. You can only interact with a very limited number of objects and people. These include NPCs that assign quests or exchange hard-coded dialogue with you, as well as shops in dedicated safe zones. In addition, you are free to shoot and kill neutral citizens, but it is nothing more than a gimmick. You don’t gain experience points and gold, or trigger any sort of karma system. Fast travel options like the taxi and subway system, are either too expensive or too limited, leaving you to walk, without even a sprint option, five to ten minutes just to progress the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main story of The Ascent is mediocre, and is nothing to write home about. You play as the classic silent protagonist doing various jobs for various corporations as you uncover what really happened to The Ascent Group. You experience everything from life in the slums all the way up to skyline suites enjoyed by the rich. On the other hand, side missions are mundane and monotonous, where most are just simple fetch quests or killing said person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neon Giant introduces some refreshing gameplay elements. Being a twin stick shooter, The Ascent offers the ability to aim both high and low on enemy targets, with a crouch/cover system behind various objects and structures found in the world. Being an rpg as well, the game offers character customization and skill trees, including cyberware augmentations and the ability to hack using a cyberdeck. There is a delightful variety of different weapons, tactical gear, and augmentations to find and utilize. These vary from pistols and shotguns to miniguns, spider bots and even your own mech robot to control! The amount of customization and differentiation in gear is very robust and promotes different playstyles, especially in co-op. Loot, on the other hand, is preset, not randomized, and often very underwhelming. Most of the time, whatever loot you collect is best sold for cash in the shops as leveling up weapons is only possible via a rare currency found in the world. In addition, old bosses become regular mobs and enemy types end up being reused a lot. Most are not worth killing because they drop little experience and gold. Exploration is also bland because oftentimes, you will walk several minutes with the intent of finding loot, only to discover that it is locked behind a higher “hack” level or is just cash or an item you already own. There is very limited replayability of this game as it is not driven by loot and there is no new game plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a game that markets itself heavily on cooperative play, The Ascent not only fails to meet the most rudimentary of expectations for an online game, but also lacks substantially in solo offline play. To put it simply, the co-op function is broken. Multiple crashes ensue after hosting or joining an online session to the point where the multiplayer aspect of the game is not only unenjoyable, but unplayable. In the brief minutes in which the online session does not crash, bugs riddle the game; one player zooms across the map at lightning speed, and enemies that are visible to one player are invisible to another. In addition, there is no option of public matchmaking yet there is the functionality to kick players from your session. If you’re only playing with friends, why would you want to kick them out? The loot, aside from important key items, is also shared among all players, which promotes unhealthy and often unfair multiplayer experiences. Moving forward, the solo player experience doesn’t bode so well either. An atrocious number of enemies that are basically just damage sponges come at you while you are tasked to point defend or survive X number of minutes, making the game extremely unbalanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many sci-fi and cyberpunk genre fan’s have kept The Ascent on their radar, especially after being disappointed by recent similar releases. After being delayed as an Xbox Series X launch title, the game still isn’t polished at all. Unfortunately, the game is nevertheless infested with bugs that include but are not limited to the inability to shoot any gun, invisible enemies (there are actual invisible enemies whose silhouettes you can see in the game), constant frame drops when there is lots of action, incorrect hit boxes, and even an infinite exp glitch. The Ascent also falls victim to the cycle of false advertising and marketing. The game is said to be “seamless, with essentially no loading screens”, yet the elevator, taxi, and subway rides that cut to black essentially act as replacement loading screens. The developers promise that “playing through the Main Missions will land you somewhere around 15 to 20 hours.” I was able to complete all the main missions and a handful of side missions in 12 hours, with a good chunk of that being straight up walking and retrying the insanely unbalanced single player boss encounters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, a co-op, loot based isometric rpg like The Ascent has the potential of being a great cyberpunk-themed game that you can play with a group of friends. The game’s world building is extremely appealing visually and aurally. However, its unsatisfying, and often unrewarding opportunities for exploration, lack of replayability, broken cooperative play, bugs, and unbalanced artificial enemy difficulty make it very difficult to appreciate its positive elements. There are also many quality of life changes that need to be addressed such as a lack of a manual save, no sprint functionality, tutorials randomly re-appearing, and Steam achievements not popping. It is sad to say that The Ascent is another over-hyped cyberpunk game that is all fluff, and no substance.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">tribes of midgard</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/reviews/self/2021/07/27/tribesofmidgard.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="tribes of midgard" /><published>2021-07-27T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-07-27T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/reviews/self/2021/07/27/tribesofmidgard</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/reviews/self/2021/07/27/tribesofmidgard.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/midgard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mos&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Batman the Batbarian, a stylish Bat-roidvania&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is no shortage of games inspired by Metroid and Castlevania, Batbarian: Testament of the Primordials is a jack of all trades. Not only is it an action-adventure puzzle game; it also successfully encompasses elements from many different genres. This eccentric and humorous, 2D pixel art, side-scrolling Metroidvania really brings out the nostalgia of old NES titles while exuberating modern day humor, aesthetic, and gaming mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an over the top fashion, you, the titular barbarian, and your pet bat Pip are immediately thrown off a cliff by a group of ogres, plummeting to the bottom of a mysterious cave. With no light source other than Pip, you must navigate your way out of this cave and figure out what happened in the events that led up to this moment. The story is told in retrospect and pieced together with flashbacks and visions as you progress in the game. Batbarian’s level design pays homage to that of a classic Metroidvania game by throwing you into situations in which you do not know how to proceed. Vines, boulders, walls block the way until you learn a new skill that allows you to advance in this direction in the future. A major component of Metroidvania games and a marker of success for games of said genre is exploration and backtracking. Batbarian incentivizes these two gameplay elements by rewarding you with secret treasure rooms where you can find permanent stat upgrades among other rare commodities. The only complaint about exploration is that there is generally no direction on how to advance, so you may end up aimlessly exploring rooms that lead nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the game holds your hand in the beginning with tutorials and hints, you will quickly be left with nothing but your brains and wits to figure out what to do next. The first few rooms of the cave serve as the game’s way of teaching you the basics, where you learn to jump, slash, and direct Pip to solve puzzles and defeat enemies. Combat mechanics are simple enough with a single attack that you can spam, and a charge attack that you can unlock later on. The puzzle mechanics are jumps, triggering switches, and directing Pip, or some combination of all three. When you level up, a slot machine mini-game appears, in which you can increase one of three stats (strength, defense, awareness). Though the minor increase of these stats barely contribute to the sense of progression, they do provide a break from the puzzling, platforming, hacking and slashing. While your trusty bat companion will be by your side the entirety of the game, you do not have full control of Pip. Instead, you command her by throwing fruit for her to eat, where different types of fruit allow her to perform a different action. This gameplay mechanic is both innovative and frustrating at times as there are puzzles that require you to command Pip and jump on a platform at the same time. Along your journey, you also meet other characters that agree to assist you and become companions with their own abilities and backstories. You also cannot control them. Instead, each character that you recruit has their own ability, from throwing bombs to shooting magic balls. These abilities are not unlimited either, as they are restricted by a stamina gauge that can only be refilled at a save point or by killing enemies. The combat and puzzles in Batbarian are more about execution than finding the solution, as the game requires you to manage the position of not only yourself and Pip, but also other enemies and obstacles on the screen. Even though the requirement of immaculate timing and execution can be frustrating sometimes, this type of gameplay is satisfying and refreshing as it forces you to think outside the box for an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a puzzle platformer, this game presents a strong narrative, and even introduces branching dialogue choices and multiple endings. A minor disappointment is that most branching dialogue options make no difference to the outcome of the story, but instead provide varietal humor for you to enjoy when playing through the game again. For a game that relies heavily on comedy, Batbarian never over does itself, managing to tell its story in a witty and subtle manner. It has a little something for everyone: a true secret ending for those looking for a fleshed-out narrative, and an in-game speed run timer for those looking to test their skills or look for a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one of the most commendable feats of this game are its performance and accessibility options. Shamefully, so many release-day titles are riddled with bugs and crashes that any 1.0 launch that plays like a 1.0 launch is a pleasant surprise. Batbarian: Testament of the Primordials runs at a silky smooth 60fps on the PS5 with extremely fast loading times and no bugs. In addition, Batbarian boasts an extremely impressive list of accessibility options that range from slow aim, health regen, more ambient lighting, boosted attack and defense and open the game up to a wider audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an in-your-face title and wacky cover art, Batbarian: Testament of the Primordials was not my cup of tea to begin with, but became more and more impressive with time. There are so many games out there today that attempt to pull off multiple gameplay elements but end up falling short of their lofty ambitions. However, Batbarian: Testament of the Primordials does a wonderful job of weaving together its beautiful artwork, ambient soundtrack, witty story, inventive puzzles, and evolving combat mechanics. Along with its refreshing arsenal of accessibility options and dozens of hours of gameplay, Batbarian is truly a hidden gem that Metroidvania and puzzle lovers will fall in love with right off the bat (no pun intended).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">out of line (full review)</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/reviews/self/2021/07/01/ool.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="out of line (full review)" /><published>2021-07-01T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-07-01T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/reviews/self/2021/07/01/ool</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/reviews/self/2021/07/01/ool.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ool.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mos&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of Line is a charming indie puzzle platformer whose world appears almost surreal due to its hand-drawn artwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You play as San, an ambiguous being trying to escape from a factory, constantly stalked by corrupted machinery. The narrative is presented without dialogue, making it obscure, and the overall story is pieced together via context clues and murals seen in the game’s luscious backdrops. Unfortunately, the story is told solely using artwork, which makes it feel incomplete. After the game, I had a gist of the overarching narrative, but ended up with more questions than answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along your way, you encounter other amorphous characters that come to your aid. Out of Line does a fantastic job of synchronizing San’s actions with these characters in order to progress by activating a platform or avoiding the treacherous machinery. For a single player game, Out of Line unexpectedly juxtaposes the loneliness felt in a world desolated by robot claws and distorted gadgetry with its “cooperative play”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of Line differentiates itself from traditional puzzle platformers with the newly introduced spear mechanic. Instead of being used as a weapon, the spear can be hurled and utilized as a platform on walls and a key to power up devices. A minor disappointment is that there is no combat in this game, despite the fact that you wield this powerful tool. It cannot be thrown as a weapon and does no damage to enemies if you attempt to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the puzzles are quite easy, the game does a great job ramping up the player to increasingly challenging problems. The puzzles start off simple enough, asking you to create a single platform with the spear, and go as far as requiring you to correctly time spear throws and jumps. There are, of course, additional puzzle elements that include stopping gadgets from rotating with your spear, guiding friendly beetle-like creatures into powering machinery and redirecting pipes to let out steam. In addition, the puzzles are not repeated for the sake of artificially prolonging the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a 2-3 hour game, Out of Line is a fun straightforward puzzle platformer filled with relaxing scenery, innovative puzzles, gorgeous art design, and a vague but intriguing story. Other than to gather all collectibles for the trophy achievement, there is little to no replayability for this game. Priced at $12.99, this game is better purchased during a sale, especially for those that are on the fence. Though Out of Line does not break the mold of puzzle platformer games, it is a game worth checking out if you have a desire for a visual and sensory experience and a free evening.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">tandem: a tale of shadows (full preview)</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/reviews/self/2021/06/13/tandem.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="tandem: a tale of shadows (full preview)" /><published>2021-06-13T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-06-13T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/reviews/self/2021/06/13/tandem</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/reviews/self/2021/06/13/tandem.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/tandem.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mos&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tandem: A Tale of Shadows is set in late 19th-century London, where a local boy named Thomas Kane has mysteriously disappeared. A young girl named Emma and her teddy bear Fenton decide to resume the investigation when the Scotland Yard are on the brink of giving up. You play as both Emma and Fenton, in tandem. You take control of emma in the top down bird’s eye view while you control Fenton from a 2-d side scroller perspective. The developers of this game alter two different gameplay mechanics and merge them to create a hybrid of sorts. This game really shines in the way the characters work in sync with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emma resides in the real world, where there are lamps, gates, carts, and spiders, while Fenton resides in a parallel shadow realm, where there are spikes everywhere. One wrong move by Fenton could mean death by impaling. By moving various light sources around, Emma is able to cast shadows for Fenton to cross over as platforms. While Emma is constantly positioning herself to create platforms for him, Fenton is opening doors to ultimately reach a light crystal, which clears the level. Each consecutive level also introduces more gameplay mechanics, such as moving objects to manipulate light sources and avoiding spiders that pose a threat to Emma, adding more complexity to each puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are only 7 levels in the demo, all of the puzzles are unique and innovative, with an ideal level of difficulty. Overall, Tandem: A Tale of Shadows delivers a fresh take on puzzle platforming that utilizes great themes and gameplay mechanics. However, during the demo, it wasn’t entirely clear how each level further progressed the search for Thomas Kane. I do hope that when the full game releases, the remaining puzzles are lengthier, a bit more challenging and flesh out the narrative more. Tandem: A Tale of Shadows will be released later this year on PC via Steam.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">ratchet &amp;amp; clank: rift apart</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/reviews/self/2021/06/11/rcra.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="ratchet &amp; clank: rift apart" /><published>2021-06-11T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-06-11T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/reviews/self/2021/06/11/rcra</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/reviews/self/2021/06/11/rcra.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/rcra.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mos&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;visual: 10/10&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;audio: 10/10&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gameplay: 9/10&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;narrative: 8/10&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;challenge: 9/10&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;replayability: 8/10&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;value: 9/10&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;personal grade: 9/10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;pros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;great introduction/character building of yuffie&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;challenging &amp;amp; unique boss fights/mini games&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;good twist on the combat system (synergize with sonon)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;runs at 4k/60fps with very fast loading times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rushed backstory of sonon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;should have been included in the base game&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;re-used base game assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;total score: 9/10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;buy at full price, sale, never: full only if you love the base game, otherwise sale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hours spent on the game: 30 hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;platinumed? n/a but all trophies obtained&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;music:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;descendant of the shinobi (yuffie’s theme)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the immaculate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sonon’s theme&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the runaround&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;happy turtle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;new bosses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gigantipede&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ramuh&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;crimson mare (scarlet)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;nero the sable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;weiss the immaculate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pride and joy mk 0.5&lt;/li&gt;
