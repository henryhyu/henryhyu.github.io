&lt;p&gt;When you think of the Mongol invasions and conquests of the 13th and 14th centuries, you probably think of Genghis Khan and the Mongol Empire expanding across Europe and Central Asia. What probably wouldn’t come to mind is that the Mongols continued to rule China into the 14th century under the Yuan dynasty and invaded Tsushima Island in Japan in 1274. 
The initial attack was made at Komoda beach on the northwestern tip of the southern island, where our story begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghost of Tsushima is an open world action-adventure game developed by Sucker Punch Productions, that follows the path of a samurai, Jin Sakai on a quest to protect his home during the historical invasion of Japan by the Mongol Empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say, first and foremost, that this is the most beautiful game I have ever played, in terms of the musical score and graphical excellence. The game is absolutely gorgeous when it comes to its visuals. The characters are depicted with lifelike detail. You can clearly see sweat particles dripping down a character’s face during a tense scene, the clan emblem on your katana as you unsheath it, or the ridges on your armor while in battle. The island of Tsushima is filled with granular weather effects, bright and vibrant colors, and an arrangement of windswept leaves, pouring rain, falling snow, chirping birds, mysterious foxes, and more that make the world feel real and alive. Even in a bloody, war-torn world, you can find peace in locations such as shrines to honor, wild foxes to pet, hot springs to rejuvenate in, bamboo to cut, and scenic locations to write haikus, each element uniquely colored. Such elegant scenery deserves to be appreciated, and Sucker Punch Productions accounts for this with Photo Mode. This feature provides a wide variety of settings that allow you to take photos and edit them to your exact liking. Throughout the game, I found myself visiting locations on the island not to complete missions, but to capture their beauty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combat of Ghost of Tsushima is addictingly satisfying, with its precise swordplay and rewarding mechanics. There are your typical light and heavy attacks. Heavy attacks break the enemy’s guard in order to damage their health. Then you have your typical guards, rolls and parries, all of which feel sharp and satisfying when you manage to perfect their timing. Some enemies have attacks that you cannot block or parry that are indicated with a red marker before they strike, perhaps inspired by Sekiro. Instead, you need to dodge or perfect dodge to create a window of opportunity to counter back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possibly where Ghost of Tsushima’s combat system shines the brightest are the boss battles, which take the form of duels. The rhythm of these duels is fast-paced, tense, and exhilarating in that the fight can be over in seconds if you don’t dodge or parry correctly. Very few games can induce the gratifying feeling you get when you perfect parry or perfect dodge. These dramaticized one-on-one battles successfully evoke samurai and kurosawa-style cinema that were popularized in the 1950s, and are heightened by an epic musical score. Intense combat themes have pounding percussion and discordant string instruments, while darker segments are filled with woodwind melodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is more to combat than just swinging your katana around. You end up unlocking an arsenal of different techniques and weapons to fit your playstyle, which gives you an added layer of freedom. You can dance between four different stances, perhaps Nioh inspired, to counter different enemy types. You obtain two types of bows, a blowdart, sticky bombs, smoke bombs and kunais. You can even learn to set your sword ablaze! The element of freedom and choice offered by this game finds its pinnacle in the option to play as the Samurai or the Ghost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you play through the story, you understand why the game is called Ghost of Tsushima and not Samurai of Tsushima. Throughout the game, you are given the liberty to play headstrong, upfront and with a samurai’s honor, or play stealthily, sneakily and deceitfully, like a ghost. Should you choose the latter, you can chain up to 3 assassinations in a row while in stealth, another extremely satisfying move to pull off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the initial battle at Komoda Beach, Jin and the rest of the samurai are quickly defeated by the overwhelming number of Mongols led by Khotun Khan. Jin’s uncle, Lord Shimura, is captured by the Mongols as Jin wakes up on the battlefield to find his allies massacred. Although on the surface, Jin’s ultimate goal is to save his uncle and liberate Tsushima from the Mongols, things take a somber and deep turn as the philosophies of old and new clash. The narrative told throughout the game definitely had some gripping story moments that made me shed a tear, especially Jin’s relationship with his uncle. The game cleverly cuts back to moments from Jin’s youth where Shimura instilled those traditions passed down from generations to further drive the amount of respect and emotion Jin has for his uncle. Pivotal to the samurai code is the concept of honor, which means knowing what is right and wrong and doing the right thing at all times, even when no one is looking. Jin gradually drifts away from these traditions and ideologies taught to him by his uncle, and begins to utilize tactics that are considered dishonorable by the samurai code. The dynamic between sticking to old noble ideals and forging a new path is Jin’s internal struggle. What is the right thing to do? Sticking to old “honorable” ways that put more lives at risk or fighting “dishonorably” to protect his people? The conflict between old and new is where Jin’s character development begins to blossom as he slowly becomes the Ghost of Tsushima.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the open world presented on the island of Tsushima is gorgeous and breathtaking, the side quests that take place in it can end up feeling meaningless and repetitive. Most generic side missions resort to a subset of the following: surveying an area, investigating and tracking footsteps, walking and riding your horse with the quest giver, fetching an item, freeing a prisoner, and killing bandits and Mongols. Another set of quests revolves around the narratives of side characters that aid you throughout the game. Aside from developing the personalities of these side characters, these quests mostly utilize gameplay elements that resort to the ones I have listed above. The one exception to all of this are special side quests called “Mythic Tales” that reward you with a legendary skill, armor or weapon and are completed through unique puzzle solving and enduring boss encounters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 4 different modes offered in Ghost of Tsushima: Easy, Medium, Hard and Lethal. I completed my platinum playthrough on Hard and will play through again on Lethal.  You can switch between difficulties at any time in the settings menu. Easy and Medium are both well-balanced for players who want to play through the game mostly for the story and open world. Hard mode is a treat for players who want a bit of challenge and Lethal (a mode added in a later patch) punishes players heavily for their mistakes while also increasing the player’s damage. This game currently does not offer new game plus nor the option to skip cutscenes, greatly reducing replayability. The added Lethal difficulty level and two different endings incentivize players to play through a second time. Aside from the main and side missions, there are also a lot of collectibles and easter eggs to obtain, some of which require exploration, platforming or puzzle solving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghost of Tsushima is a densely-packed journey that ends in spectacular fashion. Its satisfying combat, visual excellence and deep storytelling allow for a great conclusion to the PS4 Era. It is amazing that this game is only 40 gigabytes in size, as other open world games of similar visual caliber such as Red Dead Redemption 2 are over 100 gigabytes. Its minimalistic HUD, the flowing wind that guides you in the right direction, the unlimited freedom of weaponry and technique, and the heart-wrenching narrative makes the cinematic, visual, and gameplay experience much more immersive. The game’s absence of new game plus, an option to skip cutscenes, and an in-game timer are minor issues that I hope the developers will address in future updates. I encourage you to traverse the beautiful world for yourself, riding your horse, katana in one hand and the camera button in the other.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">maid of sker</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/reviews/self/2020/07/27/mos.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="maid of sker" /><published>2020-07-27T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-07-27T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/reviews/self/2020/07/27/mos</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/reviews/self/2020/07/27/mos.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/mos.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mos&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maid, short for maiden, is a girl or young woman, especially an unmarried one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maid of Sker is a first-person survival horror game that utilizes elements of stealth, puzzle-solving, backtracking, and no-weapon survival and is set in a remote derelict hotel. This game is heavily inspired by the popular British folklore legend of the Sker House and the original Maid of Sker. The original Sker House, still standing to this day, dates back to the 12th century, and has a reputation for being haunted by two ghosts: a captain of a shipwreck near Sker Point and Elizabeth Williams, the original Maid of Sker. The house was made popular by R. D. Blackmore’s book The Maid of Sker, written in 1872.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 18th century, Sker House, actually located in Kenfig, South Wales, was owned by a farmer named Isaac Williams. His daughter, Elizabeth Williams, fell in love with a local harpist named Thomas Evans. However, Isaac forbade Elizabeth from seeing him and imprisoned her in a room in the house until she agreed to marry another man of “better” financial status. Even after the unwanted arranged marriage, Elizabeth still yearned for Thomas, so much that she eventually fell ill and died. Some claim that she died of a broken heart, others that she starved herself to death. Nonetheless, her spirit is said to haunt Sker House to this day. Perhaps she was coined the Maid of Sker because she was never truly married to the person she loved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game Maid of Sker takes these real-life characters — Isaac Williams, Elizabeth Williams and Thomas Evans — as well as fictional characters and creates a tale of forbidden love and supernatural mystery that haunts the grounds of the Sker Hotel. You play as Thomas Evans, the musician, on a quest to save your lover Elizabeth, who is locked inside the confinements of the hotel. Though the initial premise of the story is based on real British folklore, there really isn’t much character development in terms of the main protagonist. You are silent across the entirety of the game.
Maid of Sker possesses most of the tropes of a typical survival horror game. It has maze-like maps, locked areas that you need to come back to later, ominous ambience, and, of course, jump scares. The jump scares do not feel cheap but instead make the environment around you feel alive. There are also refreshing and unique elements including sonic weaponry, which stuns enemies using sound waves but does not kill them, and a particular entity that knows your exact location and stalks you relentlessly. Perhaps this particular entity, whom I will not name, is inspired by a popular tyrant from the Resident Evil series. Both elements contribute to the balance of hopelessness you feel in the game, a pivotal element in any horror game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visuals for this game are quite appealing, as they pay much attention to detail and fit in with the theme of the story and lore. You are able to make out the descriptions on a wall, the facial features and words in a painting, and even the designs of a beer tap. This game has very little cutscenes, and facial features are nearly nonexistent, as the enemies are always wearing sack masks. Aurally speaking, the voice acting in the scenes containing phonographs and telephones is well-done and not awkward. Load times for this game were also very quick and seamless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This game offers 3 different difficulties: Easy, Normal, and Hard. I completed my playthrough first on Normal and am currently working my way through Hard. This game is by no means easy, nor is it unreasonably hard. I already thought Normal mode was decently challenging; I can only imagine how the difficulty would pick up on Hard! Though you are given enough healing items, ammunition and save points, you still can’t help but feel like you need to be strategic and smart with how you use them. Gameplay wise, the mechanics are simple to understand but hard to master. The gameplay is also very realistic and I admire the developers for that! The overall gist is that everything is sound-based. Enemies cannot see you but they can hear you. Running and bumping into things in your environment make noise. Coming too close to an enemy alerts them of your presence. You mitigate this by holding your breath while you walk. You cannot hold your breath while you run and sometimes you cannot hold your breath at all after running for a long time or holding it for a long time, as you need time to recover. There is an added element to this gameplay, which is coughing. You cough when you walk through dusty or cloudy areas, obviously making noise and alerting nearby enemies of your presence. The puzzles in this game are refreshing, quirky, and fun to complete, and a lot of them revolve around music, a major theme to this game. They aren’t simple to the point that you don’t need to think at all but they aren’t ridiculously tricky either. The uniqueness of each puzzle really picked at my deduction and memorization skills. There were many times in which I felt pressed for time while doing a puzzle in fear that an enemy would notice me or be alerted. Aside from all this, there are also diaries, letters, and notes to pick up that help provide insight to the events that led up to the current story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though there are collectable items to look out for in the game, I am unsure whether there is enough incentive to collect all of them. As such, my outlook on the replayability of Maid of Sker is a little skeptical. The only reason to play through the game again is to challenge yourself with hard mode. The game markets itself as one that has multiple endings. Though this is true, it does not require you to replay the entire game again. Under certain conditions, you can just reload your save file and pick the other option. I had originally expected that there would be multiple dialogue options throughout the game that would work together to dictate what ending you get. I was a little disappointed that it was so easy to unlock the other ending. Another gripe that I have is that if you start a new game, it will overwrite your previous playthrough. Though this is not a big issue, I am not sure what the purpose of this is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first playthrough of the game took around 6 hours. Given that I have played many survival horror games in the past, I will assume the average gamer would take around 7-8 hours to complete the game in their first playthrough. Since this is a survival horror game, I can definitely see this game being used by hardcore gamers to speed-run. However, during my playthrough of the game, I experienced frame drops during certain areas of the game. Fortunately, no bugs nor crashes occurred during my playthrough. For reference, my PC setup runs on a GTX1070.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maid of Sker is very big on audio cues and music. Heck, if you pre-order the game you get an entire soundtrack of folk hymns to listen to. Much of the story is driven by music sheets, instruments, and singing that are woven into the narrative. The music itself is tense, terrifying, immersive and beautiful. As you venture your way through the hotel, the floors creak, the winds chime, and the footsteps of nearby enemies can be heard, never making you feel truly safe. The only sort of solace you will find is in each phonograph room, always located behind a familiar green door. One thing I really enjoyed about each save point was that it takes the form of a phonograph, and plays a snippet of dialogue that adds to the overall development of the story. You will discover the truth behind all of this music after you play through the game for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maid of Sker was an overall delight to play, even more so considering that this game is not a Triple-A game and set at a very reasonable price. It is very much well worth the price tag if you are into stealthy survival horror, and enjoy figuring out the lore and mystery behind a well-known British folk legend. I greatly enjoyed the music, the narrative, and the unique gameplay elements that this game introduced.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
